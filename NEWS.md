# rinat (development version)

## New features

* `get_inat_obs()` can now filter photo licences with the new `photo_license` argument. For example, `get_inat_obs(taxon_name  = "Burhinus grallarius", photo_license = "CC-BY")` will only return photos licensed under a Creative Commons - Attribution. (Thank you @beausoleilmo)

## Bug fixes

* `get_inat_obs_project()` now removes all empty elements (not just the last one) when there is a mismatch between the number of observations reported and returned by the API (fixes #60)

## Others

* Update documentation to resolve "Rd \link{} targets missing package" NOTE from CRAN check
* Use `linewidth` aesthetic instead of `size` to suppress ggplot2 warning (thank you @beausoleilmo)

# rinat 0.1.9

## New features

* New `annotation` argument in `get_inat_obs()` to filter by annotation, e.g. by life stage, sex or phenology. See the [available annotations](https://forum.inaturalist.org/t/how-to-use-inaturalists-search-urls-wiki-part-2-of-2/18792#heading--annotations). (#53)
* New vignette demonstrating processing and visualising data for species distribution: `vignette("species-distribution")`

## Others

* Fix test that would error because of reaching the observation limit
* Use .Rmd.orig technique to avoid issues when CRAN tests vignette code

# rinat 0.1.8

* Properly cater for mismatch in project observation numbers to stay on CRAN (attempt in previous version did not cover all cases)
* Improve console messages in `get_inat_obs_project()`
* Skip tests that use the iNaturalist API on CRAN
* Don't error when iNaturalist or Internet is not available, as per CRAN Repository Policies (#49)

# rinat 0.1.7

* Cater for a corner case in which a mismatch between a project's reported number of observations and the actual number of observations returned produced an error when merging data frames in `get_inat_obs_project()`

# rinat 0.1.6

* New maintainer: StÃ©phane Guillou (@stragu)
* Improve documentation
* Clean up code according to CRAN feedback
* Note that 0.1.x versions of rinat will only fix existing issues, before a move to the new iNaturalist API with version 0.2 (which is likely to introduce breaking changes).

## New features

* `get_inat_obs()` can now use objects of class `Spatial` or `sf` as a bounding box (#38, @Martin-Jung and #40, @LDalby; fixes #30)
* Allow the use of an iNat `place_id` when searching for observations (commit 1d7f14f, @LDalby)

## Bug fixes

* Lower result number limit when bounding box present (#20)
* Fix result pagination in `get_obs_project()` for cases when the number of results is a multiple of 100 (#1, @vijaybarve)
* Stop `get_inat_obs()` if no search parameter(s) provided (#32, @LDalby)
* Avoid API error by limiting search results to 10000 (#32, @LDalby)
* Fix argument name in `inat_handle()` (#32, @LDalby)
* Use JSON endpoint instead of CSV to avoid `get_inat_obs_project()` failing on some projects (#35, @LDalby and #38, @Martin-Jung; fixes #28 and #37)
* Fix code according to `devtools::check()` feedback in preparation for CRAN release

# rinat 0.1.5

## Bug fixes

* Fixed bug where an error occurred when >20K records were requested and code now throws a warning to not hammer the API
* Fixed warning thrown when building vignettes on Linux systems
* Fixed bug where example code parameter names were different than actual parameter names

## New features

* Added NEWS file.
* Added a full suite of tests
* Added new vignette that builds with markdown and not hacky prebuilt PDF
